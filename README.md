PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
 Database is a huge collection of data with number of attributes and records but 
sometimes queries need to be written only for very few attributes and on limited 
records. In such scenarios and for temporary query processing the use of database 
need not be necessary. Abrupt changes made to the database without visualising the 
effects can lead to many failures.

OUTCOMES AND DELIVERABLES: 
• Application being temporary does not modify the original values in DB 
still providing a way to know the outcome of changes in prior and helps 
in deciding if changes can be made permanent 
• Easy and quick retrieving of data for temporary needs. 
• Presence of constraints helps in restricting certain values of the data.
